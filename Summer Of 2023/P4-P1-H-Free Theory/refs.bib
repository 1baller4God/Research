abstract = {A certifying algorithm is an algorithm that produces, with each output, a certificate or witness (easy-to-verify proof) that the particular output has not been compromised by a bug. A user of a certifying algorithm inputs x, receives the output y and the certificate w, and then checks, either manually or by use of a program, that w proves that y is a correct output for input x. In this way, he/she can be sure of the correctness of the output without having to trust the algorithm. We put forward the thesis that certifying algorithms are much superior to non-certifying algorithms, and that for complex algorithmic tasks, only certifying algorithms are satisfactory. Acceptance of this thesis would lead to a change of how algorithms are taught and how algorithms are researched. The widespread use of certifying algorithms would greatly enhance the reliability of algorithmic software. We survey the state of the art in certifying algorithms and add to it. In particular, we start a theory of certifying algorithms and prove that the concept is universal.}

The Coloring problem is to decide, for a given G and k, whether a k-coloring of G exists. If k is fixed (i.e., it is not part of the input), we have the decision problem k-Coloring instead. We survey known results on the computational complexity of Coloring and k-Coloring for graph classes that are characterized by one or two forbidden induced subgraphs.

(A graph G is k-critical H-free if G is H-free, k-chromatic, and every H-free proper subgraph of G is -colorable). Using this algorithm, we prove that there are only finitely many 4-critical -free graphs, for both and . We also show that there are only finitely many 4-critical -free graphs. For each of these cases we also give the complete lists of critical graphs and vertex-critical graphs. These results generalize previous work by Hell and Huang, and yield certifying algorithms for the 3-colorability problem in the respective classes. In addition, we prove a number of characterizations for 4-critical H-free graphs when H is disconnected. Moreover, we prove that for every t, the class of 4-critical planar -free graphs is finite. We also determine all 52 4-critical planar P7-free graphs. We also prove that every P11-free graph of girth at least five is 3-colorable, and show that this is best possible by determining the smallest 4-chromatic P12-free graph of girth at least five. Moreover, we show that every P14-free graph of girth at least six and every P17-free graph of girth at least seven is 3-colorable. This strengthens results of Golovach et al.},

A graph G is k-vertex-critical if G has chromatic number k but every proper induced subgraph of G has chromatic number less than k. The study of k-vertex-critical graphs for graph classes is an important topic in algorithmic graph theory because if the number of such graphs that are in a given hereditary graph class is finite, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a graph in the class is (k−1)-colorable. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of the finiteness of k-vertex-critical graphs in subclasses of P5-free graphs. Our main result is a complete classification of the finiteness of k-vertex-critical graphs in the class of (P5,H)-free graphs for all graphs H on 4 vertices. To obtain the complete dichotomy, we prove the finiteness for four new graphs H using various techniques – such as Ramsey-type arguments and the dual of Dilworth's Theorem – that may be of independent interest.}

A stronger conjecture was made recently by Conforti, Cornu{\'{e}}jols and Vu{\v{s}}kovi{\'{c}} - that every Berge graph either falls into one of a few basic classes, or admits one of a few kinds of separation (designed so that a minimum counterexample to Berge's conjecture cannot have either of these properties).

abstract = {For every k≥1 and ℓ≥1, we prove that there is a finite number of k-vertex-critical (P2+ℓP1)-free graphs. This result establishes the existence of new polynomial-time certifying algorithms for deciding the k-colorability of (P2+ℓP1)-free graphs. Together with previous research, our result also implies the following characterization: There is a finite number of k-vertex-critical H-free graphs for H of order and for fixed k≥5 if and only if H is one of K4¯,P4,P2+2P1, or P3+P1. We also improve the recent known result that there is a finite number of k-vertex-critical (P3+P1)-free graphs for all k by showing that such graphs have at most 2k−1 vertices. We use this stronger result to exhaustively generate all k-vertex-critical (P3+P1)-free graphs for k≤7.}

We prove that every (gem, co-gem)-free graph G satisfies the inequality (a special case of a conjecture of Gyárfás) and the inequality (a special case of a conjecture of Reed). Moreover, we give an -time algorithm that computes the chromatic number of any (gem, co-gem)-free graph with n vertices, while the existing algorithm in the literature takes .},

We give an explicit structural description of (P5, gem)-free graphs, and show that every such graph G satisfies χ(G)≤⌈5ω(G)4⌉. Moreover, this bound is best possible.

We prove that (1)for any integers k,t>0 and a graph H there are finitely many subgraph minimal graphs with no induced P k and K t,t that are not H-colorable and (2)for any integer k>4 there are finitely many subgraph minimal graphs with no induced P k that are not C k−2 -colorable. The former generalizes the result of Hell and Huang (2013)and the latter extends a result of Bruce etal. (2009). Both our results lead to polynomial-time certifying algorithms for the corresponding coloring problems.},
