    COmpiles Cop Wind Graphs for:
        
        - Graphs with n vertices and 3(n-2) edges for all n\ge 6 (I have some motivation that this class is interesting).
            
        - Graphs with n vertices and (n choose 2)-(n-j) edges (graphs that are only missing j edges) for j=1, 0, -1, -2.
        
        - Graphs of order n that are k-regular (all vertices have degree k) for various k\ge 3. Note that there are no k-regular graphs of odd order when k is also odd.


### Notes
    Node Cop WIn
        WHen n >= 6 there is a UMR 3-regular graph.
