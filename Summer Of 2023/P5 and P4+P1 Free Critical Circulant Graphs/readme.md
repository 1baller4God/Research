# 😲 What The Heck?
Finding P5 and P4+P1 Free Critical Circulant Graphs. 
Results show there are no 5-Critical, 6-critical or 7-critical P5 and P4+P1 Free Circulant Graphs

### 📁 DATA

    This data came from http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html
    Contains all the graphs with chromatic number 5 to 9, which are all edge critical. 

### 📁 graph-{A}

    These are the sorted data.
    These sub folders are derived from /DATA where all the graphs here are P5 and P4+P1 free   

### 📁 Finding Patterns

    Contains images of various graph-{A} which have path free propeties
